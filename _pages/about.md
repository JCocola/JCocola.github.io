I am a final year PhD student in Mathematics at [Northeastern University](https://cos.northeastern.edu/mathematics/) 
working under the direction of [Prof. Paul Hand](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/hand/index.html).

My research focuses on the mathematics of data science. As an applied mathematician, I aim at developing theory and principled algorithms for the applications of machine learning methods in fields such as inverse problems and computational science. I am in general interested in questions at the interface of statistics, optimization and computational complexity. 

In the Summer '21, I was extremely fortunate to  work on scalable machine learning methods for non-linear model reduction of dynamical systems (check it out soon!) with [John Tencer](https://jtencer.github.io/), [Eric Parish](https://ericparish.netlify.app/), [Francesco Rizzi](https://sites.google.com/site/rizziwebsite/) and [Patrick Blonigan](https://www.sandia.gov/-pblonig/) of the [Pressio Team](https://pressio.github.io/) at Sandia National Laboratories.  You should also check [Pressio4py](https://pressio.github.io/pressio4py/html/index.html) the Python binding for Pressio. 

Before Northeastern University, I was in the [Department of Computational and Applied Mathematics](https://www.caam.rice.edu/) of Rice University working on optimization and harmonic analysis of PDEs, and before that in the Department of [Mathematical Engineering](https://www.mate.polimi.it/) of Polythecnic University of Milan.
